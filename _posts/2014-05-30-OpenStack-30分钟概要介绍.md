Scheduler policy can be configured.

- AvailabilityZoneFilter
- CapacityFilter
- CapabilitiesFilter
- ...

### cinder-volume

- Huawei FusionStorage Driver
- Ceph Driver
- LVM Driver
- EMC Driver
- ...

### cinder-backup

A backup is a full copy of a volume stored in an external service. A backup can  be restored from the external service to either the same volume that the backup was originally taken from, or to a new volume.

External service:

- Ceph
- Swift

## Neutron

Neutron is a system for **managing networks and IP addresses**. Enables network connectivity as a service for other OpenStack services, such as OpenStack Compute. Provides an API for users to define networks and the attachments into them. 

![][2]

Has a pluggable architecture that supports many popular networking vendors and technologies.

- Open vSwitch
- Linux Bridge
- Cisco Nexus
- Modular Layer 2(ML2)
- Big Switch Controller Plugin
- ...

![][3]

**include core modules:**

1. neutron-server
2. neutron-dhcp-agent
3. neutron-plugin-\*-agent
4. neutron-L3-agent


### neutron-server

Accepts and routes API requests to the appropriate OpenStack Networking plug-in for action.

	POST v2.0/subnets
	{
	   "subnet":{
	      "subnet":{
	         "network_id":"d32019d3-bc6e-4319-9c1d-6722fc136a22",
	         "ip_version":4,
	         "cidr":"192.168.199.0/24"
	      }
	   }
	}

### neutron-dhcp-agent

Dynamic host IP addressing, using ***Dnsmasq***. Assign IP addresses to virtual machines.

### neutron-plugin-\*-agent

Plugs and unplugs ports, creates networks or subnets. These plug-ins differ depending on the vendor and technologies used in the particular cloud. For example, Open vSwitch, ML2, LinuxBridge.

### neutron-L3-agent

It uses the Linux IP stack and iptables to perform L3 forwarding and NAT. In order to support multiple routers with potentially overlapping IP addresses, neutron-L3-agent defaults to using Linux network namespaces to provide isolated forwarding contexts.(SNAT/DNAT)

### How to using Neutron?

**classic steps**

- create external network
- create subnetA(20.0.2.0/24) in external network as floating ip pool
- create internal network
- create subnetB(10.0.1.0/24) in internal network
- create router
- set router gate-way, associate with external network
- add router interface, associate with internal network
- boot instance in internal network
- associate floating ip to instance(SNAT/DNAT)
- access to instance from external network

## Keystone

Keystone provides a central directory of users mapped to the OpenStack services they can access. It acts as **a common authentication system** across the cloud operating system.

It supports multiple forms of authentication including standard username and password credentials, token-based systems and AWS-style (i.e. Amazon Web Services) logins. 

Additionally, the catalog provides a queryable list of all of the services deployed in an OpenStack cloud in a single registry. Users and third-party tools can programmatically determine which resources they can access.

![][2]

**core concepts**

- user
- project(tenant)
- role
- token

Projects are organizational units in the cloud to which you can assign users. Projects are also known as tenants. Users can be members of one or more projects. Roles define which actions users can perform. You assign roles to user-project pairs.

**issue token**

    POST /v3/auth/tokens
    {
       "auth":{
          "identity":{
             "methods":[
                "password"
             ],
             "password":{
                "user":{
                   "id":"0ca8f6",
                   "password":"secrete"
                }
             }
          },
          "scope":{
             "project":{
                "id":"263fd9"
             }
          }
       }
    }

## Heat

Heat provides a **template-based orchestration** for describing a cloud application by running OpenStack API calls to generate running cloud applications.

The software integrates other core components of OpenStack into a one-file template system. The templates enable you to create most OpenStack resource types, such as instances, floating IPs, volumes, security groups, users, and so on.

Runs on a central management server to poll for resource utilization statistics for resources not tied to instances or compute nodes. For example: network, subnet, floating ips, volume and so on.

### ceilometer-agent-compute

Runs on each compute node and polls for resource utilization statistics. There may be other types of agents in the future, but for now we will focus on creating the compute agent. Using libvrit, Hyper-V and VMware API. For example: CPU Stats, Network Stats, Disk Stats and so on.

### ceilometer-collector

Runs on one or more central management servers to monitor the message queues (for notifications and for metering data coming from the agent). Notification messages are processed and turned into metering messages and sent back out onto the message bus using the appropriate topic. Telemetry messages are written to the data store without modification.
